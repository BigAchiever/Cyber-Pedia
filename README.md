# Cyber-Pedia
~Alerting today for better tomorrow

In this project we tried to eliminate the CYber threats those are happening all around the Globe and creating a large issue for Technical Industries and Contries to maintain there privacy, which also makes a issue of a contry losing its economy and increase in budget.

In 2020, the average cost of a data breach was USD 3.86 million globally, and USD 8.64 million in the United States. These costs include the expenses of discovering and responding to the breach, the cost of downtime and lost revenue, and the long-term reputational damage to a business and its brand. Cybercriminals target customers’ personally identifiable information (PII) — names, addresses, national identification numbers (e.g., Social Security number in the US, fiscal codes in Italy), and credit card information — and then sell these records in underground digital marketplaces. Compromised PII often leads to a loss of customer trust, the imposition of regulatory fines, and even legal action.

So basically our motive was to prepare a overall all rounder solution and we took up this challengeand prepared a Web application which provides education to wards using the social media appliactions, how to be safe from malacious linksal all. This Web Application provides a complete solution to eliminate the Cyber Crime problems with Interactive Animated video tutorials, Catchy and precise blogs, and the tools to help you out to find if you Data is Breachedd and other tools which will make your life easy.
