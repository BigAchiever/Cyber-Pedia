== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it work with the theme that I am using? =

Our tests indicate that the elements work well with most themes that are well coded and that work with Elementor. You may need some minor custom CSS with themes that hijack the styling for heading tags by using !important keyword.

The demo site is best recreated with a theme that supports a full-width page template without sidebars. The elements can still be used in the pages of the default template.

Our plugin works well with popular themes for Elementor like [Hello Elementor](https://wordpress.org/themes/hello-elementor/), [Astra](https://wordpress.org/themes/astra/), [Ocean WP](https://wordpress.org/themes/oceanwp/) and [GeneratePress](https://wordpress.org/themes/generatepress/).

= Will your plugin affect the performance of my site? =

We run tests to ensure the speed of the site is not affected when you activate our Elementor addons. We provide a way for you to deactivate those Elementor modules that you do not require for your site to avoid loading them unnecessarily on the pages built with Elementor page builder.
